GenPairList: A Java's List basic implementation 

===============================================================================
GenPairList List implementation utility
===============================================================================
  * Using Maven 3 -       For those that are more familiar with Maven, the
                          application can be ran using Maven 3.

All methods assume you have installed JDK 1.7. This includes specifying it on
your PATH, and properly set JAVA_HOME. You can validate that JDK 1.7 is
properly installed by checking the output of running the following from the
command line

    javac -version

You will also need an internet connection to download the dependencies for the
first time

   http://maven.apache.org/download.html
2) Ensure you have setup your PATH variable so that running the following from
   the command line produces the Maven Version

     mvn --version

2) Ensure you have an internet connection
3) Open a terminal and go to the project path (where the pom.xml is located)
4) Run the following command to test the classes 

   mvn clean test

   NOTE: The first time you run the command, it may take a while as all the
         dependencies will be downloaded.
         
To run the first implementation: 

mvn clean test -Dtest=GenPairListTest

To run the secund implementation:

mvn clean test -Dtest=GenPairTree
